Features
=======================
- Can be used on any list in seconds
- You can specify navigation on top, bottom or both
- You can specify the number of items to display for each page
- Very lightweight, only 3kb!
- I’ve tested in on every browser and it is very stable
- It currently only works on lists (but you can use it on divs you would have to put them in li tags).
- It currently doesn’t have back and next buttons.
